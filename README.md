gounsubscribe.me
================

A collaborative service that provides users with URL's to unsubscribe from online services

## Contributing
The URL's are stored on the file urls.json. I want it to be easy for you to contribute. You will then add the following information:

- `name`: The name of the website
- `url`: The url where you would go if you were unsubscribing from a website

1. Fork this repository, add one site detail at a time to `urls.json`
2. Run `ruby generator.rb`
3. Commit and make a pull request

## Disclaimer
The design sucks and I know it, but I'd rather leave it to the creativity of a colaborator.
This is a colaboration project, so the more the merrier, so let put this to work and add more functionalities
